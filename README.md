# Scripts and docker compose

### Scripts
In this repository you can find different scripts for Ubuntu that I have created to do a simple install of differents utilities, there are actually the following scripts: 
- Odoo 12 + PostgreSQL
- pgAdmin4 + PostgreSQL
___
### Docker compose
The docker-compose has the following images:
- eXist-db
- MongoDB
- MySQL + PHPMyAdmin

Change the docker-compose.yml with the image you need.

> If you want to use PHPMyAdmin you must have the MySQL image to in the docker-compose.

> To change the user and passwords you just need to change the `.env file` with the correct credentials for you.
